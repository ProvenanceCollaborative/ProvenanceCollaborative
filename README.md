# Provenance Collaborative

##Hello World. 

This is the beginning of what I hope will be a beneificial collaborative for provenance researchers. If you live in Bismark, but your missing link is living in an inaccesible archive in New York, one of your fellow provenance pros can volunteer to check that document on their next visit. If you're a museum or library pro and you happen to have a bunch of old auction catalogs hanging out, you can offer to check the information for someone. I'm hoping this will be based on a mutual aid, mutual benefit, and the thrill of the provenance chase. 

I'm also hoping contributors will share their provenance woes, and let others help solve them. If you're particularly knowledgeable about a specific collector, language, or medium-- SHARE THAT AWESOMENESS. 

Until we can come up with a more elegant solution, can we file requests for research help in the issues section in the side bar?
